## Projects
(Shows image preview of the subpages’ topic which acts as a button)
- Virtual Pet (CS164)
  - In my Introduction to Computer Science course, our task for the final project was to create a virtual pet machine using what we had learned about programming and state machines. I chose to do a silly pet rock that has feelings despite its inhuman look.

- Video Game (CI102/103)
  - In my Computing and Informatics II and III classes, we formed teams with people who expressed similar interests in creating a certain type of project like a website, mobile app, video games, and more. My team and I brainstormed, designed, programmed, tested, and released a rogue-like video game inspired by rogue-like games like The Binding of Issac and Hades.

## Hobbies

### Rhythm Games
Since I was a baby, my older sister played a lot of video games on her PlayStation 2, SNES, and the various versions of the GameBoy. Two games stood out the most to my little eyes, which were the Dance Dance Revolution series and Taiko Drum Master (now known as Taiko no Tatsujin), and that was when my love for rhythm games started. Many years later, I discovered Round1 in Philadelphia where I would become a regular there and a member of a local rhythm game group, FDPF (Fashion District Philly Friends).
The rhythm games that I currently main are Project Diva Arcade Future Tone, Dance Dance Revolution, Pump It Up, and Sound Voltex. I sometimes play Gitadora, Chunithm, Maimai Finale, Music Diver, and Beatmania IIDX. 

I have been featured on Philly Inquirer's post!

### Vocal Synthesizer
I have always been a Vocaloid fan since I was little when I discovered songs featuring Hatsune Miku in a song pack for Stepmania, a Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) simulator that I found while watching DDR videos on YouTube. Ever since then, I have always remembered those songs and Hatsune Miku. In 7th grade, I became a huge Vocaloid fan when I rediscovered songs featuring other Vocaloid voicebanks on YouTube. As I continued to enjoy the various Vocaloid songs and covers I encountered online, COVID hit midway into my freshman year of high school in March 2020. Out of boredom and not wanting to spend money, I decided to try out UTAU, a free and customizable vocal synthesizer engine that was known for the old choppy robotic voicebanks that was created during the first few years of release. Soon I gave Vocaloid and SynthesizerV, which both are paid commercial engines, a try, and my love for singing vocal synthesizers continued. I created a channel with my high school friend where we posted covers using the Vocaloid engine until we parted ways and I created my own channel where I continued to post covers on the three engines mentioned.

Below are examples of the covers that I have tuned and mixed.
(show videos of the covers. Likely going to shorten them down into short previews and provide the links like the way I promote on Twitter)
